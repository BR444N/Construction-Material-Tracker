# 🏗️ Construction-Material-Tracker

**Construction Material Tracker** is an Android mobile application built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, designed to help architects and engineers manage **multiple construction projects** efficiently.

The app centralizes material tracking, cost control, and project reporting, providing a clear overview of each project and reducing errors caused by manual processes such as spreadsheets or paper notes.

# 🎯 Development Challenges

## 💡 From Problem to Solution

### **The Real Need**

Architects and engineers often manage **3–5 construction projects simultaneously**, relying on spreadsheets, paper notes, and disconnected tools to track materials, costs, and project requirements.

This fragmented workflow commonly leads to:
- Material miscalculations and budget overruns
- Limited visibility across multiple projects
- Time-consuming and error-prone manual reporting
- Difficulty sharing updated information with clients

### **Our Innovative Approach**  

Our mobile solution provides a unified platform where professionals can:
- Track materials, quantities, and costs per project in real-time
- Generate instant PDF reports for client presentations
- Monitor multiple projects from a single dashboard
- Access project data offline on construction sites
- Maintain accurate budget control and material forecasting

### **Key Challenges Overcome**

- **Real-time Sync:** Managing concurrent project data without conflicts
- **PDF Generation:** Creating professional, customizable reports on mobile devices
- **Offline Capability:** Ensuring functionality in construction sites with poor connectivity
- **Intuitive UI:** Complex data management simplified for mobile usage
