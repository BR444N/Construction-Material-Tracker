# 🏗️ Construction-Material-Tracker
**Architect Project Manager** is a mobile application built with Android + Jetpack Compose that helps architects and engineers manage multiple construction projects simultaneously.

# 🎯 Development Challenges

## 💡 From Problem to Solution

### **The Real Need**

**Architects and engineers** typically juggle 3-5 construction projects concurrently, using spreadsheets, paper notes, and disconnected systems to track materials, costs, and requirements. This leads to:
- Material miscalculations and budget overruns
- Difficulty sharing real-time data with clients
- Time-consuming manual reporting processes
- Lack of centralized project overview

### **Our Innovative Approach**  

Our mobile solution provides a unified platform where professionals can:
- Track materials, quantities, and costs per project in real-time
- Generate instant PDF reports for client presentations
- Monitor multiple projects from a single dashboard
- Access project data offline on construction sites
- Maintain accurate budget control and material forecasting

### **Key Challenges Overcome**

- **Real-time Sync:** Managing concurrent project data without conflicts
- **PDF Generation:** Creating professional, customizable reports on mobile devices
- **Offline Capability:** Ensuring functionality in construction sites with poor connectivity
- **Intuitive UI:** Complex data management simplified for mobile usage
